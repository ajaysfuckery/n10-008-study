# Software Defined Wide Area Network
<hr>
- An SDWAN is a virtual WAN architecture that uses software to manage connectivity, devices and services and can make changes in the network based on current operations.
- SDWANs integrate any type of transport architectures such as LTE, MPLS and broadband internet services to securely connect users to applications. 
- The SDWAN controller can make changes in real time to add or remove bandwidth, or to route around failed circuits.
- SDWANs can simplify the Wide Area Networking management and operations by decoupling the network hardware from it's control mechanism.
