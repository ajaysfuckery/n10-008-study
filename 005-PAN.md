# Personal Area Network
<hr>
- For close proximity networks we use a PAN (Personal Area Network).
- These are seen wtih smartphones and laptops in a conference room where local connections are used to collaborate and send data between devices.
- While a PAN can use a wired connection like Ethernet or USB, it is much more common that short distance wireless connections are used such as Bluetooth or Infrared
- PANs are intended for close proximity devices such as connecting to a projector, connecting to a printer or a coworkers computer.
- PANs usually extend for only a few meters
