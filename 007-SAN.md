# Storage Area Networks (SANs)
<hr>
- A SAN is designed for and used exclusively by storage systems. SANs interconnect servers to storage arrays containing centralized banks of hard drives or similar storage media
- SANs are usually only found in data centers and do not mix traffic with other LANs.
