<hr>
- The mGRE protocol refers to a carrier or service provider offering that dynamically creates and terminates connections to nodes on a network
- mGRE is used in Dynamic Multipoint VPN deployments. The protocol enables dynamic connections without having to pre-configure static tunnel endpoints
- The protocol encapsulates user data, creates a VPN connection to one or many nodes and when completed, it terminates the connection to the nodes
