# Wide Area Network
<hr>
- The internet is an example of a WAN.
- WANs are used to span large geopraphical locations.
- Like the internet, WANs employ both Routers and Public Links, so that's generally the criteria to define them.

- Some important ways WANs differ from LANs:
	- WANs usually need a router port or ports
	- WANs span larger geographic areas and/or can link different areas
	- WANs are usually slower than LANs
	- We can choose when and how long we connect to a WAN.
	- WANs can utilize either public or private data transport media such as phone lines
