<hr>
- A Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) is just as it sounds. it is a network covering a metropolitan area, used to interconnect various buildings and facilities usually provided over a carrier provided network.
- Think of a MAN as a smaller WAN.
- MANs typically offer high speed interconnections using in-ground fiber optics and can be very cost effective for high-speed interconnects
