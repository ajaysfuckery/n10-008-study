# Common Network Components
<hr>
- There are a lot of different machines, devices and media that make up todays networks. Three of the most common are:
	- Workstations
	- Servers
	- Hosts

##### Workstations
- Workstations are powerful computers that *run more than one Central Processing Unit (CPU)* and whose resources are available to other users on the network to access when needed.
- This sounds like a Server, but there is a difference: workstations are often employed as systems that end-users will use on a daily basis.
- Workstations *are not* client machines. Client machines can be workstations but not always.

##### Servers
- Servers are also powerful computers. They get their name because they are *"at the service of the network"* and they run special software known as the network operating system to maintain and control the network.
- In a good design that optimizes the networks performance, servers are highly specialized and are there to handle one important, Labour-intensive job. 
- This doesn't mean that a server cannot have multiple uses, but more often than not you will get better performance by dedicating one server to a specific task.
- Here is a list of common dedicated servers:
	- File-Server -> Stores and dispenses files
	- Mail-Server -> Handles email functions
	- Print-Server -> Manages printers on the network
	- Web-Server -> Manages web based activities by running Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) for storing web content and accessing webpages
	- Fax-Server -> Sends and receives paperless faxes over the network
	- Application-Server -> Manages network Applications
	- Telephony-Server -> Handles the call center and call routing, can be thought of as a network answering machine
	- Proxy-Server -> Handles tasks in place of another machine on the network, particularly an Internet connection.
