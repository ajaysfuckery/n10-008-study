# Peer to Peer or Client-Server?
<hr>
- There are two main networks you need to know about:
	- Peer-to-peer
	- Client-Server

#### Peer to peer networks
<hr>
- Computers connected together in a peer to peer network do not have any central or special authority -- they're all peers, meaning that when it comes to authority, they're all equals. The authority to perform a security check for proper access rights lies with the computer that has the desired resource being requested from it.
- It also means that the computers co-existing in a peer to peer network can be client machines that access resources and server machines provide those resources to other computers.
- This type of network works very well, as long as there aren't many computers connected to the network, users back up data locally and there isn't much of a need for network security.
