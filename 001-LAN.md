# Local Area Network (LAN)
<hr>
- As the name suggests the *Local Area Network (LAN)* is a network *usuallly restricted to a small space (office, home, building, etc).*

- We are not restricted in how many devices a LAN can hold or how big the LAN is, although if you hvae a big LAN, it is best practice to make smaller workgroups in the same LAN.

- A workgroup is a LAN of a bigger LAN.

- An example would be in a business environment; you could have 3 workgroups: Sales, Marketing and Accounting. All these workgroups would be part of the same LAN. 

- There are drawbacks to using workgroups, you must be physically connected to a workgroups LAN in order to be able to get resources from it.
- You cannot get from one LAN to another and use the server data and printing resources remotely.
- This is a typical network issue that's easily fixed by using a router to connect 2 LANs together.
