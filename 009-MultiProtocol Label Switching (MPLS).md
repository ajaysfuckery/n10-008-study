# MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS)
<hr>
- MPLS will define the actual layout of WANs protocols in use today.
- MPLS has become one of the most innovative and flexible technologies on the market and it has some key advantages over other WAN technologies:
	- Physical Layout Flexibility
	- Prioritizing of data
	- Redundancy in case of link failure
	- One-to-Many connection
- MPLS is a switching mechanism that imposes labels (numbers) to data and then uses those labels to forward data when it arrives at the MPLS network.
- The labels are assigned on the edge of the MPLS network, and forwarding inside the MPLS network (cloud) is achieved through virtual links instead of physical links. 
- Prioritizing data is a huge advantage (example: voice data could have priority over basic data based on labels)
- Since there are multiple paths on an MPLS network, some redundancy is provided
